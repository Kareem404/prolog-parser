# üß† Prolog Parser (Built with Lark)

A syntactic parser for **Prolog** programs built in Python using the [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) parsing library.  
This project was originally developed as part of a university coursework and later refined for clarity, usability, and error reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The parser checks whether a given Prolog program is **syntactically correct** based on a custom-defined grammar implemented in Lark.  
It also provides **meaningful error messages** for common syntax issues, such as:
- Missing opening or closing parentheses
- Unknown or invalid characters
- Unexpected tokens

It can parse multiple `.txt` files (e.g., `1.txt`, `2.txt`, ‚Ä¶) in sequence and writes the results to an `output.txt` file.

## üß© Features

‚úÖ Custom grammar definition for core Prolog constructs  
‚úÖ Detects syntax errors with detailed messages  
‚úÖ Automatically processes multiple input files  
‚úÖ Handles unknown characters and missing parentheses  
‚úÖ Uses [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) for grammar-based parsing  
‚úÖ Lightweight and easy to extend

## üß± Grammar Structure

The parser defines rules for:
- **Clauses** (`predicate :- predicate_list.`)
- **Queries** (`?- predicate_list.`)
- **Atoms**, **Variables**, **Structures**, and **Numerals**
- **Character classes** (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols)

Example of grammar definition:
```python
program: [clause (clause)*] query
clause: predicate [":-" predicatelst] "."
query: "?""-" predicatelst "."
...

## üöÄ How to Run
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
```
pip install lark regex
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add your Prolog programs
Place your Prolog programs in files named:
``` 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, ... ```
Each should contain a valid (or invalid) Prolog program.
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the parser
```
python prolog.py
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ View the output
Check the generated `output.txt` file to see whether each file was syntactically correct or what errors were found.
